# Intro
Directed network graph of Valheim's crafting recipes created in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). The thickness of each edge (line connecting nodes) is the amount of source material needed to create target material. Node colour is dependant on how much of a hub a given node is - dark orange means it's not a hub at all, white-ish means somewhat of a hub, and violet means it's a big hub.

## Data source
All data used to create this graph was taken from [game8.co](https://game8.co/games/Valheim/archives/321005) using Google Spreadsheets.

## To-do
[x] Create a static PNG version of the graph
[ ] Create an interactive version of the graph using Python's Plotly/Dash package
[ ] Upgrade the data source to [ign.com](https://www.ign.com/wikis/valheim/Items_List#) as it's more comprehensive
